<br> First we write basic program for taking input and output of initial angles and target coordinates.
<br>
Hereâ€™s how we can approach Part B:
Input:
Initial joint positions/angles.
Target position coordinates (3D).<br>
Algorithm Overview:
Initialize the joint positions based on the initial angles.
Iteratively adjust the joint positions forward and backward until the end effector reaches the target position or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
If the end effector reaches the target position within the specified tolerance, the point is considered reachable.<br>
Output:
Determine whether the target position is reachable (yes/no).
It seems like the code snippet you provided is an incomplete implementation of the **FABRIK (Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics)** algorithm. The FABRIK algorithm is commonly used in robotics and computer graphics to solve inverse kinematics problems for articulated structures like robotic arms or character skeletons.

Let's break down the code snippet:

1. **`forward_kinematics(link_lengths, joint_angles)`**:
   - This function calculates the **end effector position** (usually the tip of the robotic arm) using forward kinematics.
   - It iterates through the link lengths and joint angles, updating the end effector's position based on trigonometric calculations.
   - The result is a 3D coordinate representing the end effector's position.

2. **`fabrik(link_lengths, target_position, initial_angles, epsilon=0.01, max_iterations=100)`**:
   - This function implements the FABRIK algorithm.
   - The goal of FABRIK is to find joint angles that position the end effector at a specified target position.
   - It starts with an initial guess for joint angles (`initial_angles`) and iteratively adjusts them to minimize the difference between the current end effector position and the target position.
   - The algorithm alternates between a forward pass (updating joint positions) and a backward pass (correcting joint angles).
   - The process continues until the distance between the current end effector position and the target position is smaller than a specified threshold (`epsilon`) or until a maximum number of iterations (`max_iterations`) is reached.

3. **Incomplete Part**:
   - The snippet ends abruptly with an incomplete line: `new_joint_angle`.
   - It seems that the calculation for the new joint angle is missing here.
